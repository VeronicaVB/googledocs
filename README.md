# Googledocs  Activity Module
Create G Suite Document (doc, sheet, presentation) in gdrive  from a moodle course.

Up to this stage the module can: 
Create a "master" file and update it. By running a cron task, it will generate  the appropiate copies for students enrol in a course.

You need a service account to be able to run the cron task.

It is a work in progress and there are many things to improve.
